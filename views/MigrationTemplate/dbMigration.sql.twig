-- Auto-generated migration file. Please customise for your needs (and remove this line ;-)!

-- NB: for mysql, you can add multiple statements in a single SQL file, separated by the semicolon character,
--     however be careful about the total length, as you might go over the maximum statement length.
--     In that case, either use multiple sql migrations, or a single yml migration where each step is a sql statement
